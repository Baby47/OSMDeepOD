  "description": "This challenge shows coordinates which represent yellow street crossings (crosswalks) our process found in aerial images of greater area of Zurich. Besides tag [highway=crossing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcrossing) you can add more detail with [key crossing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:crossing). Once integrated in OpenStreetMap (OSM) crosswalks are shown in online maps (e.g. OSM Cycle Map/OpenCycleMap) and they are useful for pedestrian navigation apps (e.g. OsmAnd). So help OSM to improve this missing information!",
  "instruction": "Check if there is a crosswalk. If yes, fix it by adding tag [highway=crossing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcrossing) and ev. with [key crossing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:crossing); else mark (q) or skip it (w).",
  "help": "A crosswalk node needs to be placed as part of a way. It requires the tag [highway=crossing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcrossing). Hint for iD editor: just type Crossing. For more details see [key crossing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:crossing). The coordinates have been extracted at December, 2nd. 2015, by using a parallel image detection process. Our approach is optimized for yellow crossings of Switzerland (other cantons may follow).
